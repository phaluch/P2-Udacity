EXPLANATION
Major upgrades in storage, dataflow and stability. RDS instance now has IOPS optimized storage, and is multi-AZ. EC2 instances in both Azs have more EBS to handle better buffering, and the number of load balancers was also increased. Overall the system now has several redundancies that basically guarantee a steady service regardless of outages.
