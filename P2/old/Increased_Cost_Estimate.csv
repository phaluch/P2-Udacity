Acknowledgement
* AWS Pricing Calculator provides only an estimate of your AWS fees and doesn't include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of AWS services.

EXPLANATION
Increased the number of load balancers, so as to better manage traffic. Also changed EC2 instances to reserved, so we can guarantee a more reliable service. Overall, increased capacity of EC2 and RDS, as well as max. Connections. Storage is now IOPS optimized, as well as all EC2s.
