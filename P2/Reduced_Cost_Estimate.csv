EXPLANATION
I the most important change was changing to single-AZ deployment. That seriously hinders disaster recovery efforts, but it's what fits the budget. Besides that, I cut down transfer rates from 20Tb to 10Tb, and didn't customize so much the peak usage behaviour of the users. While that will cause problems in a max-effort situation, it will most likely not affect the regular use.
